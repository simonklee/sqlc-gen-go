# sqlc-gen-go

See [Building from source](#building-from-source) and [Migrating from sqlc's
built-in Go codegen](#migrating-from-sqlcs-built-in-go-codegen) if you want to
use a modified fork in your project.

## Usage

```yaml
version: "2"
plugins:
  - name: golang
    wasm:
      url: https://downloads.sqlc.dev/plugin/sqlc-gen-go_1.3.0.wasm
      sha256: e8206081686f95b461daf91a307e108a761526c6768d6f3eca9781b0726b7ec8
sql:
  - schema: schema.sql
    queries: query.sql
    engine: postgresql
    codegen:
      - plugin: golang
        out: db
        options:
          package: db
          sql_package: pgx/v5
```

## Building from source

Assuming you have the Go toolchain set up, from the project root you can simply `make all`.

```sh
make all
```

This will produce a standalone binary and a WASM blob in the `bin` directory.
They don't depend on each other, they're just two different plugin styles. You can
use either with sqlc, but we recommend WASM and all of the configuration examples
here assume you're using a WASM plugin.

To use a local WASM build with sqlc, just update your configuration with a `file://`
URL pointing at the WASM blob in your `bin` directory:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: golang
    wasm:
      url: file:///path/to/bin/sqlc-gen-go.wasm
      sha256: ""
```

As-of sqlc v1.24.0 the `sha256` is optional, but without it sqlc won't cache your
module internally which will impact performance.

## Migrating from sqlc's built-in Go codegen

We’ve worked hard to make switching to sqlc-gen-go as seamless as possible. Let’s say you’re generating Go code today using a sqlc.yaml configuration that looks something like this:

```yaml
version: 2
sql:
  - schema: "query.sql"
    queries: "query.sql"
    engine: "postgresql"
    gen:
      go:
        package: "db"
        out: "db"
        emit_json_tags: true
        emit_pointers_for_null_types: true
        query_parameter_limit: 5
        overrides:
          - column: "authors.id"
            go_type: "your/package.SomeType"
        rename:
          foo: "bar"
```

To use the sqlc-gen-go WASM plugin for Go codegen, your config will instead look something like this:

```yaml
version: 2
plugins:
  - name: golang
    wasm:
      url: https://downloads.sqlc.dev/plugin/sqlc-gen-go_1.3.0.wasm
      sha256: e8206081686f95b461daf91a307e108a761526c6768d6f3eca9781b0726b7ec8
sql:
  - schema: "query.sql"
    queries: "query.sql"
    engine: "postgresql"
    codegen:
      - plugin: golang
        out: "db"
        options:
          package: "db"
          emit_json_tags: true
          emit_pointers_for_null_types: true
          query_parameter_limit: 5
          overrides:
            - column: "authors.id"
              go_type: "your/package.SomeType"
          rename:
            foo: "bar"
```

The differences are:

- An additional top-level `plugins` list with an entry for the Go codegen WASM plugin. If you’ve built the plugin from source you’ll want to use a `file://` URL. The `sha256` field is required, but will be optional in the upcoming sqlc v1.24.0 release.
- Within the `sql` block, rather than `gen` with `go` nested beneath you’ll have a `codegen` list with an entry referencing the plugin name from the top-level `plugins` list. All options from the current `go` configuration block move as-is into the `options` block within `codegen`. The only special case is `out`, which moves up a level into the `codegen` configuration itself.

### Global overrides and renames

If you have global overrides or renames configured, you’ll need to move those to the new top-level `options` field. Replace the existing `go` field name with the name you gave your plugin in the `plugins` list. We’ve used `"golang"` in this example.

If your existing configuration looks like this:

```yaml
version: "2"
overrides:
  go:
    rename:
      id: "Identifier"
    overrides:
      - db_type: "timestamptz"
        nullable: true
        engine: "postgresql"
        go_type:
          import: "gopkg.in/guregu/null.v4"
          package: "null"
          type: "Time"
```

Then your updated configuration would look something like this:

```yaml
version: "2"
plugins:
  - name: golang
    wasm:
      url: https://downloads.sqlc.dev/plugin/sqlc-gen-go_1.3.0.wasm
      sha256: e8206081686f95b461daf91a307e108a761526c6768d6f3eca9781b0726b7ec8
options:
  golang:
    rename:
      id: "Identifier"
    overrides:
      - db_type: "timestamptz"
        nullable: true
        engine: "postgresql"
        go_type:
          import: "gopkg.in/guregu/null.v4"
          package: "null"
          type: "Time"
```
